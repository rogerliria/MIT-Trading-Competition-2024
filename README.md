## Overview

This repository showcases the solutions and code implementations for two main cases featured in the MIT Trading Competition:

1. **Five Rings Market Making Case**: Involves market-making simulations with four different scenarios focusing on click trading, price discovery, and strategy development.
2. **DRW Data Science Case**: Centers around quantitative modeling and the creation of profitable trading strategies using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

### Five Rings Market Making Case

This folder contains code for four different scenarios:

- **Scenario 1: Introduction**
- **Scenario 2: Multiple Contracts**
- **Scenario 3: Spread**
- **Scenario 4: Chaos**

Each scenario folder includes scripts that simulate the respective trading environments and strategies used to maximize profits.

### DRW Data Science Case

Contains the Python implementation of the trading strategy developed for the DRW Data Science Case. The file includes the strategy function designed to maximize the t-statistic of the PnL over all ticks.
